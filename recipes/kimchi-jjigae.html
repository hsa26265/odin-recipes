        <h2>Warm, Comforting Kimchi Jjigae</h2>

    <p>As the cooler seasons approach, I can&rsquo;t help but crave a steaming bowl of Korea&rsquo;s greatest dish (in my very humble opinion), Kimchi Jjigae. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite go-to dishes when I need a healthy and flavorful staple for the week that reheats perfectly everytime.</p>

        <h3>How to Make Your Kimchi-Jjigae:</h3>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a neutral oil in a pot over medium heat. I usually go for vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Once hot, add in the whites of your green onion and garlic, reserve the green part for later. Sautee for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add in the kimchi and gochujang and sautee for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in your 4 cups of broth (I prefer 4 cups of water mixed with 4 chicken buillon cubes for a richer flavor!) and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once boiled, reduce to a simmer and let cook for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in frozen rolled beef and allow to cook in the broth, then add in your silken tofu.</li>
        <li>Top with sesame oil and green onion, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
