        <h2>Your New Weeknight Staple!</h2>
    </p>

    <p>Fettucini Bolognese has got to be one of my favorite, go-to weeknight dinners. Robust in flavor and deeply filling, this dish is the perfect choice when planning your meals. My bolognese focuses on meaty, umami flavours that pack a serious punch. Mushrooms and artichoke hearts help enhance the flavours of the ground beef alongside the onion and garlic.</p>

        <h3>How to Make Our Pasta:</h3>
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by finely dicing half a white onion and mincing your garlic, mushrooms, and artichoke hearts.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over medium-heat add in your ground beef and sausage. Chop up the meat in the pan and allow to brown. Once browned, remove to a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add a little olive oil to the pan if needed. Toss in your onions, and sautee &lsquo;til soft (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Once your onions have softened, add in your mushrooms, artichokes, and garlic, sauteeing for about 1 min.</li>
        <li>Add in your tomato paste and allow to slightly caramelize (about 1 minute). Then add in your wine to deglaze the pan. Let reduce to half.</li>
        <li>When your wine has reduced, add in your can of crushed tomatoes and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Allow sauce to simmer for about 15 minutes (cook your pasta according to box instructions during this time.)</li>
        <li>When your pasta has finished, add 1/4 cup of the pasta water to your sauce.</li>
        <li>Voila! Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
